# Temporal Neural Network for Optical Flow

The Optical Flow algorithm consists of providing the apparent motion of objects, surfaces and edges in a visual scene.
In this code, an Optical Flow algorithm has been developed.
However this algorithmis is very different from the classical optical flow algorithms for two main reasons:

  1. This algorithm is a machine learning algorithm basedd on neural network,
  2. The input data are not frames but events. The camera used is an event based camera
